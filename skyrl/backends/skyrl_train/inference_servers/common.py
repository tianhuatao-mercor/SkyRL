# TCPStore selection and there is no probe/bind race left to work around.

    ``DP_TCPSTORE_PROBE_OFFSET`` to it and probes ``DP_TCPSTORE_WINDOW`` ports
    from there for the engine's TCPStore. Reserving a single port would
    therefore guarantee nothing -- what matters is that co-located engines probe
    *disjoint* windows, so derive the base from the caller's assigned
    ``start_port`` (unique per server actor, ``SERVER_PORT_STRIDE`` apart) rather
    than from an ephemeral port.

    Deriving from ``start_port`` also keeps the window out of the ephemeral
    range, where vLLM's own ``get_open_port()`` (which only excludes 10 ports
    around ``VLLM_DP_MASTER_PORT``) and every other transient socket on the node
    would compete for it.

    Note the returned base itself sits ``DP_TCPSTORE_PROBE_OFFSET`` *below* the
    window, i.e. inside the preceding server's block. That is only safe because
    nothing binds the base when DP is disabled -- every vLLM caller of
    ``get_next_dp_init_port()`` is guarded on ``data_parallel_size > 1``, and on
    that path vLLM overwrites the master port itself. Recheck if that changes.
