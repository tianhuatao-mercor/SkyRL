"""Runtime registration of the SkyRL ``sharded_rdt`` weight-transfer engine into
the pinned ``vllm==0.26.0`` wheel.

Importing this module (idempotently) registers ``ShardedRDTWeightTransferEngine``
in vLLM's ``WeightTransferEngineFactory`` under the name ``"sharded_rdt"`` so
``GPUWorker.load_model`` builds it (via ``create_engine``) when
``weight_transfer_config.backend == "sharded_rdt"``.

vLLM 0.26.0 types ``WeightTransferConfig.backend`` as
``Literal["nccl", "ipc", "sparse_nccl"] | str`` (accepts arbitrary strings), so —
unlike the 0.20.2 stopgap — NO Literal relaxation is needed; only the factory
registration.

This must run on the **driver** (which builds the ``WeightTransferConfig`` in
``build_vllm_cli_args``) AND on **every vLLM worker** process (which constructs
the engine via the factory). It is imported from:
  * ``new_inference_worker_wrap.py`` — loaded by vLLM via ``--worker-extension-cls``
    on every worker before model init.
  * ``inference_servers/utils.py`` and ``weight_sync/__init__.py`` — driver side.

``vllm`` is a Linux-only optional dependency, so vLLM imports are inside the
function and ImportError is swallowed on platforms without vLLM.

REMOVAL: delete this module + its imports once SkyRL's pinned vLLM registers the
``sharded_rdt`` engine in ``WeightTransferEngineFactory`` natively.
