"""Trainer-side driver for the sharded-RDT (NIXL pull) weight-sync backend.

RDT matches vLLM's trainer-send model — a ``WeightSource`` + a
``TrainerWeightTransferEngine`` + a ``VLLMWeightSyncClient``, where the engine owns
the round trip and the inference workers pull. ``ShardedRdtTransferStrategy``
(``sharded_rdt_strategy.py``) presents :class:`RdtWeightSyncSender` through SkyRL's
``WeightTransferSender`` interface, overriding ``send`` so no chunk stream or
metadata is ever materialized.

Three ``WeightSource`` flavors, selected by extractor flavor in
``make_weight_source``: ``_FsdpWeightSource`` (all-gather via ``full_tensor()``),
``MegatronStackedWeightSource`` (PP-local + EP-local, stack-granularity gathers) and
``MegatronWeightSource`` (the whole-model Megatron-Bridge ``export_hf_weights``
fallback).

    """Build the QKV split's index tensors on the weight's device, not the host.

    ``split_qkv_weights`` and friends extract Q/K/V from Megatron's interleaved
    layout by indexing the (CUDA) packed weight with ``torch.arange`` index
    tensors, which default to CPU. Indexing a CUDA tensor with CPU indices forces
    a blocking H2D copy plus a stream sync per gather, so the host stalls for
    however much GPU work happens to be queued — measured at ~0.65 s per sync per
    rank of ``ne_bridge`` at 235B, and the producer is the sync's pacer, so it
    lands in the wall roughly 1:1.

    Rather than vendor the three functions (257 lines of interleave math that would
    then have to track upstream, and whose divergence would silently produce the
    WRONG Q/K/V split), this wraps them and defaults ``torch.arange``'s device to
    the weight's for the duration of one call. No upstream logic is copied, so an
    upstream change cannot desync us; and if upstream adopts the same fix, the
    ``setdefault`` simply stops mattering. The window is one function call in a
    single-threaded export, and the four ``arange`` calls inside each function are
    exactly the index tensors this is for.

    The in-tree fix is four characters — ``device=qkv.device`` on the aranges —
    and belongs upstream as a PR against megatron-bridge, since it taxes every
    megatron->hf export of every GQA model. Until that lands, reaching it from
    outside gets the same result with no forked copy to carry.

    stage gets ``None``, which every ``megatron_to_hf`` already treats as "not
    mine" and skips. TP and EP gathers are untouched — they run within a stage.

    Patched on the CLASS rather than on the tasks' mapping instances, for two
    reasons. Nothing in megatron-bridge overrides these two methods (they are
    defined once on ``MegatronParamMapping``), so one wrap covers every mapping
    including the ``_HFNameSuffixMapping`` wrapper, which reaches them through
    ``__getattr__``. And ``AutoMapping`` builds its delegate lazily INSIDE
    ``megatron_to_hf``, so an instance-level change — clearing ``pp_group`` to

    that actually performs the broadcast.

    exported tensor**. For per-expert MoE archs (qwen3_moe: 128 experts x 3
    projections per layer) that is ~400 small latency-bound collectives per
    layer and dominates sync time (~13ms/tensor measured; 235B => ~470s/sync).

    This source keeps the bridge for everything EXCEPT the per-expert weights
    (attention, norms, router, embeddings — via ``conversion_tasks`` filtering,
    the same subset-export idiom ``MegatronWeightExtractor`` uses for
    bucketing), and gathers the experts itself at STACK granularity — two big
    collectives per MoE layer instead of ~400:

      fc1 stack [n_local, 2F, H] --ep all_gather--> [E, 2F, H] --pp broadcast-->
      per-expert HF views: gate_proj = fc1[e, :F], up_proj = fc1[e, F:],

      chunk, fc2 verbatim, no transpose, dtype pass-through; global expert
      index e = n_local * ep_rank + i, matching all_gather rank order).

    Ordering contract: expert names are emitted immediately after the bridge's
    non-expert names of the same layer, so each ``model.layers.N.*`` block stays
    contiguous and ``layerwise_groups`` partitions the combined list cleanly.
    ``metadata()`` and ``__iter__`` derive from the same plan, so they always
    agree. Dense models have no expert tasks and degenerate to the plain
    filtered==full export.

    Falls back (see ``make_weight_source``) for grouped-export archs (qwen3.5
    style ``is_grouped_export`` mappings emit fused HF names — different
    contract) and can be disabled with ``SKYRL_RDT_STACKED_EXPERTS=0``.

    never gathers across pipeline stages (each stage yields only its own
    layers, declared through ``held_names()``), and at ep>1 it never
    all-gathers experts (only this coordinate's experts are materialized,
    also declared through ``held_names()``; foreign experts yield ``None``).
    The RDT consumers route every pull to a rank that holds the data. Layouts
    this cannot serve (a gather group produced by two stages: tied embeddings,
    MTP) demote the source, and ``make_weight_source`` delegates to the plain
