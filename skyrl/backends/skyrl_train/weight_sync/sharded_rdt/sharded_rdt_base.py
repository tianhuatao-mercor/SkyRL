"""Trainer-side weight-transfer base ABCs, vendored from the vLLM RDT fork.

These classes live in ``vllm/distributed/weight_transfer/base.py`` in the
``vllm-rdt-weight-sync`` fork. The pinned ``vllm==0.26.0`` wheel DOES ship
trainer-side ABCs at that path (``WeightSource``, ``TrainerWeightTransferEngine``,
``TrainerInitInfo``, ``VLLMWeightSyncClient``, ``ParamMeta``,
``materialize_full_tensor``) — but a NARROWER version of them: it has no
``layerwise_groups``, and its ``WeightSource`` declares only ``metadata`` /
``__iter__``, without the ownership and group extensions
(``held_names`` / ``groups`` / ``iter_groups``) the sharded-RDT engine is built on.
So the fork's versions are copied here VERBATIM rather than imported.

REMOVAL: once SkyRL's pinned vLLM carries the *fork's* versions of these — the
group and ownership channels included — delete this module and repoint
``sharded_rdt_trainer.py``'s import back to
``vllm.distributed.weight_transfer.base``.

Two consequences of that split, both load-bearing:

* ``layerwise_groups``, ``WeightSource.groups()`` and ``WeightSource.iter_groups()``
  live HERE (as in the fork's ``base.py``), because they define what a group index
  means for a ``WeightSource``. ``sharded_rdt_common`` re-exports
  ``layerwise_groups`` for callers that already import it from there.
* ``WeightTransferEngine.defers_processing`` / ``drain_pending()`` are declared on
  the fork's ABC, but the *worker*-side ABC comes from the pinned wheel (verified
  on 0.26.0), which has neither. So ``sharded_rdt_engine`` declares both on the concrete
  engine class, and ``inference_servers/layerwise_reload.py`` probes them with
  ``getattr`` — which works against either ABC.

    rank and every consumer, because it is derived from one rank's `metadata()`
    order.

    Keying on the index rather than a literal prefix needs no per-architecture
    naming table: ``model.layers.0.``, ``model.language_model.layers.0.``,
    ``transformer.h.0.``, ``backbone.layers.0.`` and a vision tower's

    whole model, which defeats the per-layer bound below.

    Un-indexed names split by POSITION relative to the first indexed one: the pre
    block (embeddings) and the post block (the final norm, `lm_head`, and any
    inter-stack projector). Post lands last however early it arrived, which is
    what a pipeline-parallel source needs — Megatron-Bridge streams the last
    stage's output block *before* its layers.

    Stacks come out in first-appearance order of their prefix and ascending index
    within it, whatever order the source yielded them, so a source can normalize
    an arbitrary export order by flattening this partition.

    Backends that gather and free per group (sharded RDT) also use it as the unit

    plans) on `self`. Full-resync backends (NCCL, IPC) take a `WeightSource` at

    `send_weights()`. Backends that push per-round deltas instead (e.g. sparse
    patches) leave `source` as `None` and take their payload as a `send_weights`
    argument.

    Unlike the worker engine, the trainer side does not take a
    `WeightTransferConfig`: the backend is selected from the init info's
    `backend` `ClassVar` (so callers pass only the init info), and the static
    wire params (packed, buffer sizes) ride the backend-specific
    `TrainerInitInfo`, which the sender also propagates to the worker at the init
    handshake.

    Multi-rank trainers: `trainer_init` and `send_weights` are

    `trainer_init` into `is_sender`. Non-sender ranks still run every
